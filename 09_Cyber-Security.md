# 🔐 Enabling Security and Resiliency

## 🌩️ Why Resiliency Matters

Strategically align IT security with a unified strategy.

### Threat Landscape
- **Traditional:** Power outages, storms, data center failures  
- **Modern:** Cyberattacks, ransomware, data exfiltration

### Key Questions
1. Do you have a risk-based security and resiliency strategy?  
2. Is your application dependency map up to date?  
3. Can your technology support rapid recovery?  
4. How often do you test your resilience?

## ⚙️ Keeping Up with the Pace of Change

Organizations face challenges onboarding and managing tools.

### Process Flow
1. Needs analysis  
2. Proof-of-concept (PoC)  
3. Bake-off evaluation  
4. Integration into environment  
5. Ongoing tuning & integration  
6. Continuous improvement

### Key Questions
1. Do you have a process for selecting and onboarding software?  
2. How do you train users for tool adoption?  
3. How do you manage ongoing tuning and integration?  
4. Can you federate tools for automation and visibility?
