## 🧪 Dell Penetration Testing & Attack Simulation Management
### 🔄 Proactive vs Reactive Security Strategies

#### ✅ Proactive
- Attack surface reduction
- Access restriction
- Detection & response
#### 🚨 Reactive
- Incident response
- Recovery

---

### 🔁 Continuous Validation of Security Controls
- Frequent, automated attack simulations ensure controls are functioning properly
- Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tools updated with latest threat indicators and behaviors
---

## 🛡️ Advantages of Attack Simulation Management

### 🔐 Reduce Risk of Cyberattacks
- Prepare for crises like ransomware
- Harden environments and reduce attack surface
- Limit blast radius in case of breach

### 📋 Support Regulatory & Insurance Objectives
- Helps meet cybersecurity regulations
- Reduces risk of non-compliance

### 🔍 Validate Security Controls
- Confirms existing infrastructure is working as expected

---

## 🧭 Combined Pen Testing + Attack Simulation

- Monthly automated breach and attack simulations identify emerging gaps
- Pen testing inspects high-risk pathways to critical assets
- Ad hoc testing provides insights into novel threats
- Ensures controls are properly configured across attack vectors
